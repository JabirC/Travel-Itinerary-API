# Travel-Itinerary-API

## API Idea

* Lets you search for all the tourist attractions in a given city or country
* Add to the database of tourist attractions
* Keep track of tourist attractions a user wants to visit next


## Database Schema

I decided to make the Itinerary table a little different from my API idea by adding an ItineraryId column to make it easier for the model to recognize that it was the primary key. In addition, I decided to make the table only have max 4 attractions in the itinerary instead of making it expand when a user ran out of columns. Making it expandable would have caused a headache in terms of structuring the model for a table thats dynamic.

### DELETE

<br/>

```
DELETE  /API/Itinerary/ClearItinerary/{userName}
```
* Clears the itinerary for the given user
* Decided to make this endpoint a DELETE method instead of the PUT method I initially planned in the API dea presentation because PUT usually requires a request body but in this endpoint there is no need for a request body

<br/>

<br/>

```
PATCH  /API/Itinerary/addItinerary/{userName}
```
* Adds an attraction to the itinerary of the given user
